### About
Website created to represent myself, it may be small and simple but it was done by hand and by me, with guidance and advice from [Pav][1]. Learnt a lot about how websites work and are created even for a little site like this, and aim to learn more. Tried my best to ensure that the code is only HTML and CSS as I don't really want to complicate things for myself. Tried to base my design appearance on Google's Material Design Colour Palette.
#### Enjoy.
