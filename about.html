      <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="about-item">I created this website for one purpose and that was to allow me to have somewhere to represent myself online, I also fancied the challenge of designing and creating a website. Although the site is simple and therefore doesn’t appear to have much design work implemented, but I tried and used Material Design Colour Palette as a baseline/goal. I did create it by myself however some design input and code education was done by <a href="http://pavsidhu.com">Pav</a>. Although it may have meant that some features that I wanted to include were not added or will be added but I have managed to only use CSS and HTML to create the site just to ensure that it wasn’t too big for a small website.</p>

        <p class="about-item">The pictures in question will be updated and changed, as they currently stand the watermarks are ugly, distracting and in desperate need of change and shall aim to do that shortly. I shall also hopefully proceed to add more pictures to the gallery over time as I take more, currently trying to learn new methods and techniques but progress is slow. Man those watermarks are hideous.</p>
