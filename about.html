      <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="about-item">I created this website for one purpose and that was to allow me to have somewhere to represent myself online, I also fancied the challenge of designing and creating a website. Although the site is simple and therefore doesn’t have much design work implemented, but I tried nonetheless and used Material Design Colour Palette as a baseline/goal. I did create it by myself however some design input and code education was done by <a href="http://pavsidhu.com">Pav</a>. Although it may have meant that some features that I wanted to include were not added or will be added but I have managed to only use CSS and HTML to create the site just to ensure that it wasn’t too big for a small website.</p>

        <p class="about-item">The pictures in question will be updated and changed. I shall also hopefully proceed to add more pictures to the gallery over time as I take more, currently trying to learn new methods and techniques but progress is slow.</p>
